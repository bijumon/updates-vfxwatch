"I admit that I do not know whether there is any infinite personality or not,
 because I do not know that my mind is an absolute standard. But according to
 my mind, there is no such personality; and according to my mind, it is an
 infinite absurdity to suppose that there is such an infinite personality. But
 I do know something of human nature; I do know a little of the history of
 mankind; and I know enough to know that what is known as the Christian faith,
 is not true. I am perfectly satisfied, beyond all doubt and beyond all
 peradventure, that all miracles are falsehoods. I know as well as I know that
 I live -- that others live -- that what you call your faith, is not true."
         [Robert G. Ingersoll, unfinished article, reply to Rev.
          Lyman Abbott's article "Flaws in Ingersollism" printed
          in the North American Review, April 1890]
