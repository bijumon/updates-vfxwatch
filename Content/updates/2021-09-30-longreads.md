Lem's 1964 story, published in English for the first time, tells the tale of a scientist in an insane asylum theorizing that the sun is alive.

[The meditative empathy of Susanna Clarke’s Piranesi - Vox](https://www.vox.com/culture/22677485/piranesi-susanna-clarke-vox-book-club) by Constance Grady

There is something meditative about watching Piranesi live, the purity of his life and the kindness of it. And Piranesi’s kindness is possible in part because he lives in such communion with the House, which is his world. He respects the House and knows how to live within it, and in turn the House blesses him with its bounties. 

[The Sellout won the Booker Prize. This blistering passage on white male privilege shows why. - Vox](https://www.vox.com/culture/2016/11/7/13502322/sellout-paul-beatty-booker-prize) by Constance Grady

In the end we found it impossible to ignore the impassioned pleas of the Lost City of White Male Privilege, a controversial municipality whose very existence is often denied by many (mostly privileged white males). Others state categorically that the walls of the locale have been irreparably breached by hip-hop and Roberto Bolaño’s prose ...

[9 Fictional Friendships that Explore Male Intimacy - Electric Literature](https://electricliterature.com/9-fictional-friendships-that-explore-male-intimacy/) by Jackson Frons

At the fulcrum of Roberto Bolaño’s kaleidoscopic epic Savage Detectives, are the poets Ulises Lima and Arturo Belano, the author’s alter ego.

[‘Heartbreak is part of doing anything you want to do’ | Paul Beatty | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/jun/11/paul-beatty-interview-the-sellout-booker-prize), Kate Kellaway interviews Paul Beatty

You are wary of other people’s questions. What questions do you ask yourself?

I don’t ask myself big questions. I’ve a friend who was struggling, saying: “I don’t know why I am here… what is the purpose?” I said: “There is no purpose.” If there were a purpose, then I would be frozen.

[Considering the Novel in the Age of Obama](https://www.vulture.com/2017/01/considering-the-novel-in-the-age-of-obama.html) by Christian Lorentzen

Environmental despoliation, economic regression, and enthroned sexism and bigotry are already on the cards. For all the turmoil on our streets and abroad, literary historians may look back at the Obama years as a time of tranquility ...

[Joan Didion: Only Disconnect](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/103/didion-per-harrison.html)
Off Center: Essays by Barbara Grizzutti Harrison (1980).

I am disinclined to find endearing a chronicler of the 1960s who is beset by migraines that can be triggered by her decorator's having pleated instead of gathered her new diningroom curtains. These, and other assorted facts -- such as the fact that Didion chose to buy the dress Linda Kasabian wore at the Manson trial at I. Magnin in Beverly Hills -- put me more in mind of a *neurasthenic Cher* than of a writer who has been called America's finest woman prose stylist.
