`Two-fer` or `2-fer` is short for two for one. One for you and one for me.

Given a name, return a string with the message: "One for X, one for me." Where X is the given name. However, if the name is missing, return the string: "One for you, one for me."

**Hint**: return a formatted string literal from the function, with a [default argument value](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#default-argument-values) when `name` isn't given. It is possible to use [%-formatting](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/#option-1-formatting) or [str.format()](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/#option-2-strformat) to solve this.

``` python
# two_fer.py
def two_fer(name="you"):
    answer = f"One for {name}, one for me."
    return answer
```
