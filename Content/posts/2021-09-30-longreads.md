[The meditative empathy of Susanna Clarke’s Piranesi - Vox](https://www.vox.com/culture/22677485/piranesi-susanna-clarke-vox-book-club)

> There is something meditative about watching Piranesi live, the purity of his life and the kindness of it.

He respects the House and knows how to live within it, and in turn the House blesses him with its bounties.
