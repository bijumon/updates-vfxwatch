Given a string representing a matrix of numbers, return the rows and columns of
that matrix.

So given a string with embedded newlines like:

```text
9 8 7
5 3 2
6 6 7
```

representing this matrix:

```text
    1  2  3
  |---------
1 | 9  8  7
2 | 5  3  2
3 | 6  6  7
```

your code should be able to spit out:

- A list of the rows, reading each row left-to-right while moving
  top-to-bottom across the rows,
- A list of the columns, reading each column top-to-bottom while moving
  from left-to-right.

The rows for our example matrix:

- 9, 8, 7
- 5, 3, 2
- 6, 6, 7

And its columns:

- 9, 5, 6
- 8, 3, 6
- 7, 2, 7

In this exercise you're going to create a **class**.  _Don't worry, it's not as complicated as you think!_

``` python
# matrix.py

class Matrix:
    def __init__(self, matrix_string):
        rowStrings = [r.split() for r in matrix_string.splitlines()]
        self.matrix = [[int(num) for num in row] for row in rowStrings]

    def row(self, index):
        return self.matrix[index - 1]

    def column(self, index):
        return [ column[index - 1] for column in self.matrix]
```
